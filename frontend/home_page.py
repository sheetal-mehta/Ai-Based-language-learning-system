We all know how learning a language or practicing a language is, especially when you are not in a classroom environment.

More specifically, facing challenge in recalling or trying to pronounce certain words and sentences. Even when you
         you try to pronounce them, you do not know certainly if its correct or not. This is where this system comes into picture!
         You can practice and get immediate assessment on your pronunciation of certain words, and senteces of your choice.

Moreover, if you want to practice and improve your language skills, the Grammatical error correction system gives you immpediate 
         correction on your errors and feedback on the errors you made.
         
This is not enough? Then you can use the thesaurus section to improve and expand your vocabulary, by typing 
         in the words you want the synonyms for!
